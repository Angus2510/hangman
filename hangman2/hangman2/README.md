how to play the game:
                1) in this game you are meant to guess the word that is provided.{"\n"}
                2) The user must click on the alphabet buttons, if the letter is in the word then it will be placed in the spot where the letter is in the word
                3) every letter that you get wrong, the image will go closer to the end of the game and you have one less chance to get to guessed word
                4) if all the turns have gone and you havn't guessed the word then you will lose the gameOver
                5) if you have guessed the word before all your lives are done that means you have won the game.
